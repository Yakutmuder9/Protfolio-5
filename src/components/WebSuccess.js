          <h2>3 boxes every successful website needs to cheek</h2>
          <p>
            There are millions of websites but not every website is successful.
            I have focused on and mastered the right things that make a website
            successful.

        </div>
        <div className="success-card-container">
          <div className="success-card">
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <h4>Beautiful yet high converting</h4>
            <p>
              This goes hand in hand. To stand out in the crowd a website needs
              to be extremely beautiful thus converting more leads. Isn't it the
              best combination for a website?

          <div className="success-card">
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <h4>Get you ahead of the competition</h4>
            <p>
              It's 2021 and the competition just became so much crazier. It's
              the perfect time to invest in a good website that will leave the
              competition way behind.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="success-card">
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <h4>Amaze your customers</h4>
            <p>
              Who doesnâ€™t appreciate beautiful and well-crafted things? Your
              audience will do it too by taking action. In a world full of
              boring websites give them an amazing experience.
